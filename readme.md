# Neon Runtime
This is a collection of utilities and convenience facilities for my projects primarily.

You may use it on your own projects under the terms of the BSD-3-Clause license.

## Requirements to building this code
The runtime has a small number of requirements, all of them are described bellow.
### Submodules
From a fresh clone if you didn't do a recursive clone:

Init all submodules and update them.
```shell
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

### Not in tree
These are the requirements that are not included in the vendor tree:
* jemalloc
